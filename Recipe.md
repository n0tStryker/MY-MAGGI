# MY-MAGGI
This Recipe is on about how to make my favourite snack.
In this you will require:
lots of cheese(depends on your choice how many slices;I prefer around 3 or 4)
1 and a half glass of water (glass should be 250 ml) 
1 packet of maggi.

How to make it:
1)first we will use the one glass of water and boil it and wait for 5 mins.
2)We will add the noodles in the boiled water and wait another minute.
3)We will then add the Maggi tastemaker and wait for around another 5 mins.
4)Then we will add 1 slice of cheese.
5)We will server it hot and then (if you have more then 1 slice of cheese) add the rest of the slices on the maggi.

And thats how you make my Maggi. Hope you like it :)
